Must run read_all_runs to generate resultsMatrix before:
```
Figure 2: margin_histo(resultsMatrix)  
Figure 3b: head_orientation(resultsMatrix)
Figure 4: mean_SPV_plot(resultsMatrix)
```

The following programs are independent of read_all_runs:
```
Figure 1: find_slope_example
Figure 3a: head_orientation_histo
```
